## 💾 Data Persistence on Netlify

### Important: File Storage

Netlify's file system is **read-only** after build. Your current file-based storage won't persist.

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Netlify Blobs (Recommended)
- Netlify's built-in storage
- Free tier available
- Easy to set up

#### Option 2: External Database
- MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
- Supabase (free tier)
- PostgreSQL

### For Now (Testing):
Your site will work, but data won't persist between deployments. You'll need to re-add magazines after each deployment.

**I can help you set up persistent storage if needed!**

## 🔐 Environment Variables

To add secrets:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Click **"Add a variable"**
3. Add:
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` = `saif`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = `saif1234`
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Redeploy site
