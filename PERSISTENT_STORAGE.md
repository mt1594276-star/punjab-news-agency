# 💾 Persistent Storage Implementation

## ✅ Your Data is Now Saved Permanently!

All changes you make in the admin panel are now **permanently saved** to files on your server.

---

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### File-Based Storage System

Your website now uses a **file-based storage system** that saves all data to JSON files:

1. **Magazines** → Saved to `data/magazines.json`
2. **Contact Information** → Saved to `data/contact.json`

### How It Works

```

## 📁 Data Storage Location

All your data is stored in the `data/` folder:

```
punjab-news-agency/
├── data/
│   ├── magazines.json      ← All magazines
│   └── contact.json         ← Contact information
├── app/
├── components/
└── ...
```

### File Contents:

**data/magazines.json**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Punjab Today - January 2025",
    "description": "Latest news...",
    "date": "2025-01-15",
    "category": "Current Affairs",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "views": 12500,
    "coverColor": "from-blue-500 to-blue-700",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

**data/contact.json**
```json
{
  "email": "info@punjabnews.com",
  "phone": "+92 XXX XXX XXXX",
  "address": "Punjab, Pakistan",
  "facebook": "#",
  "twitter": "#",
  "instagram": "#",
  "youtube": "#"
}
```

## ✅ What's Saved Permanently

### Magazines (data/magazines.json)
- ✅ Add new magazine → Saved immediately
- ✅ Edit magazine → Updated in file
- ✅ Delete magazine → Removed from file
- ✅ All magazine details (title, description, rating, etc.)

### Contact Information (data/contact.json)
- ✅ Email address
- ✅ Phone number
- ✅ Physical address
- ✅ Facebook URL
- ✅ Twitter URL
- ✅ Instagram URL
- ✅ YouTube URL

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### When You Add a Magazine:
1. Fill form in admin panel
2. Click "Publish Magazine"
3. Data sent to API route
4. API saves to `data/magazines.json`
5. File written to disk
6. **Data is permanent!**

### When You Update Contact Info:
1. Edit fields in admin settings
2. Click "Save Contact Information"
3. Data sent to API route
4. API saves to `data/contact.json`
5. File written to disk
6. **Data is permanent!**

### When Server Restarts:
1. Server starts
2. Reads `data/magazines.json`
3. Reads `data/contact.json`
4. **All your data is still there!**

- Loads data on each request
- Saves data on each change
- Falls back to defaults if file missing

**lib/contactStore.ts**
- Uses fileStorage for persistence
- Loads data on each request
- Saves data on each change

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Folder:
- Created automatically on first run
- Don't delete while server is running
- Safe to backup anytime
- Can be version controlled

### JSON Files:
- Human-readable format
- Can be edited manually (carefully!)
- Automatically formatted with 2-space indentation
- UTF-8 encoding
